## Setup and Installation

### Dependencies

- **VirtualBox**: This is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
- **Vagrant**: This is the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

### Installation Instructions

1. **Install VirtualBox and Vagrant**:
   - Download and install VirtualBox and Vagrant from the links provided above.
   - Ensure both applications are correctly installed by running `vagrant --version` and `VBoxManage --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dev_Vagrant_Box.git
     ```

3. **Start the Vagrant Environment**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `Vagrantfile`:
     ```bash
     cd Dev_Vagrant_Box
     ```
   - Run the following command to start the virtual machine:
     ```bash
     vagrant up
     ```
   - Once the machine is running, you can SSH into it:
     ```bash
     vagrant ssh
     ```

## Usage

After setting up your Vagrant environment, you can use the virtual machine as your development environment. Here are a few basic commands to manage the virtual machine:

- **Suspend the virtual machine**:
  ```bash
  vagrant suspend
  ```
  Use this command when you want to pause the virtual machine and return to it later without losing the current state.

- **Halt the virtual machine**:
  ```bash
  vagrant halt
  ```
  This command stops the virtual machine. You will need to reboot it with `vagrant up` next time.

- **Destroy the virtual machine**:
  ```bash
  vagrant destroy
  ```
  Use this command when you want to completely remove the virtual machine and start over.
