# Dev_Vagrant_Box

## Project Overview

Dev_Vagrant_Box is a Vagrant configuration designed to set up a virtual machine tailored for software development, with a particular focus on DevOps practices and virtualization. This project is ideal for developers who are seeking a streamlined and efficient development environment. It leverages the power of Vagrant and virtualization to provide a consistent and reproducible development environment that can be easily shared and modified.

## Setup and Installation

To use Dev_Vagrant_Box, you need to have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Once you have the above dependencies installed, you can set up Dev_Vagrant_Box by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Vagrantfile.
3. Run `vagrant up` command to start the virtual machine.
4. Once the machine is up, run `vagrant ssh` to log in to the virtual machine.

## Usage

Once you're inside the virtual machine, you can start developing your software. The project directory from your host machine is synced to the `/vagrant` directory in the virtual machine, so you can edit files on your host machine and run them inside the virtual machine.

For example, if you have a Python script `hello_world.py` in your project directory:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
You can run this script inside the virtual machine like this:

```bash
python /vagrant/hello_world.py
```
